This branch is only here for documentation.

It is a standalone branch and is never meant to be merged into another branch.

One can upload pictures and other files here that can be linked in the Github Wiki without wasting space in other branches.

Basically, this branch acts as a file server that exists as long the repository exists so links to pictures never get lost.

This is why this branch only contains this README and all the files are move into the folder documentation.
