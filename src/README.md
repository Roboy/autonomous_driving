# Further AD Modules

This folder contains additional ROS-packages for Roboy. The idea is that you can clone and build the [autonomous_driving_src](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving_src/) repository easily and are able to record data and run simulations on any machine. Packages contained here can also be cloned to your catkin workspace but might require significantly more effort to build.
