## Description

In order to use the Intel Realsense Camera with the SICK lidar an extrinsic calibration needs to be done.
This can be done with the RADOCC and RADLOCC toolbox submodules. You will require a MATLAB license for this.

An extensive step-by-step [Tutorial](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving/wiki/Calibration:-Extrinsic-calibration-between-camera-and-lidar) can be found in the Github wiki of this repository.

There is also the official [RADOCC](http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/akas9185/AutoCalib/AutoCamDoc/index.html) and [RADLOCC](http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/akas9185/AutoCalib/AutoLaserCamDoc/index.html) website that provides additional informaton
